Fine-Tuning FinBERT for Financial Text Classification

FinBERT is a domain-specific language model that has been pre-trained on financial text data.
Which means it understands the words like profit , revenue , pe ratio etc 

Project Overview
I fine-tuned the FinBERT model to classify financial  news headlines 
into three categories:
Macro (label = 0): Government policies, inflation, GDP, RBI, trade, etc.
Stock (label = 1): Company-specific news like profits, expansions, deals.
Market (label = 2): General market trends, indices, volatility, global cues.

Why Only Three Classifications
FinBERT Original Training: 3-class sentiment classification (negative, neutral, positive)
Minimal Viable Classification: Covers major financial news types
Accuracy vs Complexity Trade-off: More categories = lower accuracy + more training data needed

Bloomberg Terminal: ~200 News Categories
Reuters News Codes: ~1,500 Categories
Our Approach: 3 focused categories for better accuracy
